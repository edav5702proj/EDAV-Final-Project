# Proposal

## Research topic
In this project, we focus on the waiting time at Magic Kingdom. We will try to find the pattern for every year, such as a possible peak appearing every summer. We will also create a heat map showing the number of people waiting in lines in Disneyland. Besides, the correlation between different factors will also be reported.
## Data availability
The data comes from thrill-data.com. The data includes the most recent daily or hourly average waiting time for every facility in the area for decades.
