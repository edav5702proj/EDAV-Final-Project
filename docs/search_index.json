However, visitors often spend a long time waiting for facilities. They may wait for hours for a five-minute roller coaster. Thus, we want to find a way to spend less time waiting and enjoy as many facilities as possible. In this project, we will examine the data of Disneyland waiting times, find the pattern, and provide an optimal visit plan. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Many visitors complained about the waiting time at Disneyland. It is possible to wait in line for 6 hours to take a ride (Source). In this project, we are interested in exploring the waiting time at the Disney Magic Kingdom to gain some insights into the general trends and patterns. Moreover, we hope the patterns discovered can help visitors plan their trip wisely to avoid waiting in long lines and enjoy as many attractions as possible in a limited time. In the future, our project can facilitate finding specific hypotheses for further supervised machine-learning studies predicting the waiting time of each attraction. Disney provides an app showing the waiting time for each attraction, but it does not reflect historical data to show the trend. We focus on exploring the waiting times from a larger picture perspective and show how the time varies daily, monthly, and annually. We will also create some graphs to visualize the data and illustrate trends and patterns. 2.2 Data availability The data comes from Touringplans.com. The data includes the most recent daily or hourly average waiting time for some selected attractions in the Magic Kingdom of Disney and the metadata that are useful for conducting analysis. As described in the website, the data is collected directly from 3 sources: from app users of Touringplans.com Disney’s My Disney Experience app observation from the staffs of Touringplans.com on sights. As for its availability, the data can be downloaded directly from the website for free in CSV format. A CSV document downloaded contains all wait time data for a specific attraction. The wait time is recorded at different time intervals (every 1 ~ 10 minutes) for each day. For example, the raw data for attraction Dumbo and Laugh Floor are displayed below. &nbsp; &nbsp; Fig. 1: Example Data for Dumbo (left) and Laugh Floor (right) By our investigation, the data is available for each park opening day from 01/01/2015 to 12/28/2021, and the website provides data for 41 attractions in the Magic Kingdom. Furthermore, we also identified that there are many useful metadata from Touringplans.com. For instance, we have the access to the metadata for each attraction of the Magic Kingdom, which records useful information including its unique code, duration, and where it locates. Note that information like durations are extremely helpful when analyzing the waiting time of attractions. The example dataset is displayed below. Fig. 2: Example Metadata In addition, we found a data dictionary from the same site, which explains the meaning of each attribute in the dataset in detail and helps us disambiguate each column. For example, the attribute SACTMIN stands for the “Actual Wait Time” while SPOSTMIN represents the “Standby Post Wait Time”. As for our plan of importing data, we will manually download all source CSV file (including metadata) and process them into R dataframes. During processing, we will heavily rely on the data dictionaries and metadata that we mentioned before to decide which columns and rows are important. We will also transfer metadata into R dataframe and combine that with all source files. New statistics will be computed if necessary. With all of these source data and metadata, our analysis and envisionment mentioned in the preceding section are feasible.

Therefore, it is extremely crucial to examine the validity and reliability of the assumptions that our analysis will rely on and think about any inductive biases that we implicitly impose in the analysis. Specifically, there are two important aspects that we want to research on: Assumption 1: the dataset is valid and reliable (i.e. no internal conflicts) Assumption 2: waiting time statistic is a representative metric for analysis 4.1.1 Assumption 1 Unlike most other groups whose datasets come from official sources including government websites and database where verifications are conducted, the dataset we used is collected from a thrid party organization Touringplans.com. Therefore, validation of dataset is necessary and important. We performed our validation by identifying internal conflicts of datasets and compare our preliminary analysis with reports from the official (i.e. Disneyland). The first simple task we tried to validiate our dataset is to predict top seven attractions according to their popularity. In our dataset, we computed the average waiting time for each attraction (denoted by AWT in the plot) and made usage of the average_wait_every_hundred statistic (i.e. denoted by AWT_100 in the plot) to do the prediction. Note that AWT_100 represents the average waiting time for every hundred people. Therefore, attractions that are popular should be those with high AWT but low AWT_100. According to this reasoning, we identified that the top 7 most popular attractions from the scatter plot above: Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Space Mountain, Jungle Cruise, Splash Mountain , Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Pirates of Caribbean, and Haunted Mansions. Based on the report of most popular attractions by magicguides.com and the introduction from Disneyland Officials the most popular 7 attractions are: Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Jungle Cruise , Splash Mountain, Peter Pan’s Flight, Haunted Mansions, Pirates of Caribbean, and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. Our prediction results matched with most of their analysis (6/7), and we can improve our confidence about the reliability of the source data from this small prediction task. In addition, there is no internal conflict in our dataset because they are all time series data for different attractions. 4.1.2 Assumption 2 By calculating and plotting the waiting time for each attraction, we identified that average waiting time itself is not a good indicator for popularity of the attraction. Note that we observe that the average waiting time is not always higher for popular attractions identified in previous section. Thus, we should not solely leverage on that when analyzing the popularity of attractions. However, with the power of time series data, it is powerful when analyzing trend and designing visiting plans. ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;7 dwarfs train&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;astro orbiter&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] &quot;barnstormer&quot; ## ## [[4]] ## [1] &quot;big thunder mtn&quot; ## ## [[5]] ## [1] &quot;buzz lightyear&quot; ## ## [[6]] ## [1] &quot;carousel of progress&quot; ## ## [[7]] ## [1] &quot;country bears&quot; ## ## [[8]] ## [1] &quot;dumbo&quot; ## ## [[9]] ## [1] &quot;enchanted tiki rm&quot; ## ## [[10]] ## [1] &quot;hall of presidents&quot; ## ## [[11]] ## [1] &quot;haunted mansion&quot; ## ## [[12]] ## [1] &quot;it s a small world&quot; ## ## [[13]] ## [1] &quot;jungle cruise&quot; ## ## [[14]] ## [1] &quot;liberty sq riverboat&quot; ## ## [[15]] ## [1] &quot;mad tea party&quot; ## ## [[16]] ## [1] &quot;magic carpets&quot; ## ## [[17]] ## [1] &quot;peoplemover&quot; ## ## [[18]] ## [1] &quot;peter pan s flight&quot; ## ## [[19]] ## [1] &quot;pirates of caribbean&quot; ## ## [[20]] ## [1] &quot;regal carrousel&quot; ## ## [[21]] ## [1] &quot;space mountain&quot; ## ## [[22]] ## [1] &quot;splash mountain&quot; ## ## [[23]] ## [1] &quot;tom land speedway&quot; ## ## [[24]] ## [1] &quot;under the sea&quot; ## ## [[25]] ## [1] &quot;winnie the pooh&quot; 4.2 General Pattern Analysis - Macro-Level With confidence of dataset validity, we first analyze the pattern of waiting time of each attraction spanning from 2015-01-01 to 2022-01-01, by which we can identify the peak season of Walt Disneyland. Note that for this section, we are doing macro-scale analysis, implying we will focus on the average waiting time for each month for each attraction. 4.2.1 Secular Trends To identify secular trend, we computed the average waiting time for each month for all attractions and then made the following time series plot. Here is the main observations: Obs #1: From 2015 to 2019, there is a general trend of increasing waiting time. Exp: as Disneyland became more famous, there are more tourists but the attractions remain unchanged, which result in an increasing of waiting time. Obs #2: From about 2019 to 2020, there is a huge decreasing in terms of waiting time. Exp: this corresponds to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, which result in the temporary close of Disneyland and the huge decreasing of number of tourists even after reopening. Obs #3: Starting from 2020, there is a general trend of increasing waiting time Exp: this corresponds to the fact that people are back to normal life from COVID disruption. Obs #4: There is an obvious abnormality in the plot (2020-04-01 to 2020-10-01), where the waiting times are all zeros, which correpond to the closure of Disneyland. (Note that there is a design choice for plotting; see Data Cleaning section for details) Note: According to Disneyland’s Officials, Disneyland was closed during COVID-19 outbreaks Below are the time series plot for the average waiting time changing pattern for each attraction in Disneyland. Click on the plots to zoom in. Through this juxtaposition, we can easily observed that the four trends and abnormalites that we identified eariler is universal across all attractions, and we do not subject to Simpson’s Paradox. 4.2.2 Identify cyclical patterns Time series data commonly share some underlying cyclical patterns. We utilized faceting techniques to isolate average waiting time for each year and identify the following trends and patterns: (Explanations are based on news, activities, and reports published by Disneyland Officials) Obs #1: We managed to identify cyclical patterns by isolating AWT for each year. Obs #2: In general, there are two peaks of AWT for attractions in Disneyland: April - July (spring peak) and December - January (winter peak). Exp: Spring AWT peak corresponds to the fact that there are tons of activities held in that period, whereas winter peak is the direct result of Christmas Holiday (Note that Florida is a good place to stay for many people during winter). Obs #3: In 2020, we observed a completely different trend due to the temporary closure of the park. Obs #4: In 2021, the general AWT decreases but the peaks are still around spring and winter. Exp: the decreasing waiting time (compared to 2015 to 2019) accounts for the influence of COVID-19 to people’s life, while the consistency of peak seasons confirmed the validity of previously-observed trends. Similarly, we can plot the AWT for each attraction as what we did for the previous section to further confirm the global trends. Click on the plots below to zoom in. Here are the main takeaway from these plots: Obs #1: Most of the attractions share the similar patterns as identified before. Obs #2: For attractions whose data are not sufficiently large (refer to Data Cleaning section for details), spring and winter peaks are observed as well. Obs #3: Combined previous two observations, we can safely conclude that we do not suffer from Simpson’s Paradox and the trend is valid. Obs #4: From this juxtapositin, we can easily discover features about each attraction. For example, we can quickly guess that Hall of Presidents was closed in 2017 (annoucement from Disneyland Officials confirmed our conjecture). ## X name duration ## 1 0 7 dwarfs train 3.0 ## 2 1 pirates of caribbean 7.5 ## 3 2 astro orbiter 1.5 ## 4 3 regal carrousel 2.0 ## 5 4 big thunder mtn 7.0 ## 6 5 splash mountain 18.0 ## 7 6 space mountain 10.0 ## 8 7 jungle cruise 8.0 ## 9 8 mad tea party 1.5 ## 10 9 dumbo 1.5 ## 11 10 magic carpets 1.5 ## 12 11 peoplemover 10.0 ## 13 12 under the sea 7.0 ## 14 13 barnstormer 2.0 ## 15 14 winnie the pooh 4.0 ## 16 15 enchanted tiki rm 14.5 ## 17 16 haunted mansion 10.0 ## 18 17 buzz lightyear 4.5 4.2.3 Section Conclusion A main takeaway of this macro-level analysis for tourists is that spring and winter are two peak seasons that the AWT is higher than that of other time; this trend is exhibited both before and after COVID-19, and will be consistent in the future. Therefore, one natural suggestion is to visit the park in summer or fall. 4.3 General Pattern Analysis - Micro-Level 4.3.1 Average Waiting Time per Facility per day From the graph above, we can see that the waiting time drops by almost 20 minutes at the beginning of January, which can be explained by the start of the Spring semester. Since students occupy a large proportion of visitors, as they are going back to school, there are fewer visitors to Disneyland, thus requiring tourists to wait much less time. The waiting time then steadily increases until April 1, when it decreases by almost 25%. This is probably becauase the Disneyland was closed on April, 2022. The number stays at the same level for about four months before dropping dramatically in August, which can be explained by the start of the Fall semester. From September to January, the waiting time generally increases, except for the first half of October and the second half of November, when it suddenly increases and then goes back to the original level. These two peaks correspond to the Fall break and Thanksgiving break, when many students are freed from school and visit the Magic Kingdom. We believe that the waiting time is related to students’ schedules. When students need to go back to school, the waiting time is short. When they have breaks, the waiting time is longer. The sudden drops in January and August are two significant pieces of evidence that support our argument. 4.3.1.1 Average Waiting Time per Facility per day before and after Covid-19 We set January 1, 2020 as the threshold which separates the time before and after Covid-19 affected the world. The blue line represents the average waiting time before Covid, and the red line is for the period after Covid. Generally, the waiting time is shorter after Covid, especially during June and July. 4.3.2 Average Waiting Time per Facility per weekday The graph above shows the average waiting time per facility every weekday. We do expect Saturday has a relatively high waiting time before we start the project. On the other hand, surprisingly, Sunday has the shortest waiting time, while Monday’s and Wednesday’s waiting times are above average. 4.3.2.1 Average Waiting Time per Facility per weekday before and after Covid-19 The graph above shows the waiting time every weekday before and after Covid. On every weekday, the average the less after Covid than before Covid. There was a tremendous drop on Saturday, and the waiting time dropped from 31.45 minutes per facility to 26.26 minutes. This indicates that for every two and half hours, the tourists can enjoy one more facility after the Covid than before.The tourists spend less time on waiting and enjoy more facilities after the Covid.

Generally, duration and waiting time are positively correlated. The longer the duration, the longer the waiting time. There are also some outliers, such as the 7 dwarf train. This facility only lasts 3 minutes, but the tourists must wait 79 minutes on average. Moving the mouse to the data point to see more information.

Tourists need to wait longer time during Spring and Winter than Summer and Fall. We believe it is related to students’ schedule. The average waiting time (AWT) significantly drops after the spring semester and the fall semester begin. There are also two small sudden peak around the Fall break and the Thanksgiving break. Besides the seasonal patter, we also notice that people need to wait more on Saturday and Monday. While Sunday and Thursday cost less time on waiting. What’s more, due to Covid-19, the AWT in recent two years is less than before 2020. ## Recommendation We recommend tourists visit Disneyland on a Sunday during Fall.The weather is comfortable and they don’t have to wait for a long time.
