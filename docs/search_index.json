However, visitors often spend a long time waiting for facilities. They may wait for hours for a five-minute roller coaster. Thus, we want to find a way to spend less time waiting and enjoy as many facilities as possible. In this project, we will examine the data of Disneyland waiting times, find the pattern, and provide an optimal visit plan. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Many visitors complained about the waiting time at Disneyland. It is possible to wait in line for 6 hours to take a ride (Source). In this project, we are interested in exploring the waiting time at the Disney Magic Kingdom to gain some insights into the general trends and patterns. Moreover, we hope the patterns discovered can help visitors plan their trip wisely to avoid waiting in long lines and enjoy as many attractions as possible in a limited time. In the future, our project can facilitate finding specific hypotheses for further supervised machine-learning studies predicting the waiting time of each attraction. Disney provides an app showing the waiting time for each attraction, but it does not reflect historical data to show the trend. We focus on exploring the waiting times from a larger picture perspective and show how the time varies daily, monthly, and annually. We will also create some graphs to visualize the data and illustrate trends and patterns. 2.2 Data availability The data comes from Touringplans.com. The data includes the most recent daily or hourly average waiting time for some selected attractions in the Magic Kingdom of Disney and the metadata that are useful for conducting analysis. As described in the website, the data is collected directly from 3 sources: from app users of Touringplans.com Disney’s My Disney Experience app observation from the staffs of Touringplans.com on sights. As for its availability, the data can be downloaded directly from the website for free in CSV format. A CSV document downloaded contains all wait time data for a specific attraction. The wait time is recorded at different time intervals (every 1 ~ 10 minutes) for each day. For example, the raw data for attraction Dumbo and Laugh Floor are displayed below. &nbsp; &nbsp; Fig. 1: Example Data for Dumbo (left) and Laugh Floor (right) By our investigation, the data is available for each park opening day from 01/01/2015 to 12/28/2021, and the website provides data for 41 attractions in the Magic Kingdom. Furthermore, we also identified that there are many useful metadata from Touringplans.com. For instance, we have the access to the metadata for each attraction of the Magic Kingdom, which records useful information including its unique code, duration, and where it locates. Note that information like durations are extremely helpful when analyzing the waiting time of attractions. The example dataset is displayed below. Fig. 2: Example Metadata In addition, we found a data dictionary from the same site, which explains the meaning of each attribute in the dataset in detail and helps us disambiguate each column. For example, the attribute SACTMIN stands for the “Actual Wait Time” while SPOSTMIN represents the “Standby Post Wait Time”. As for our plan of importing data, we will manually download all source CSV file (including metadata) and process them into R dataframes. During processing, we will heavily rely on the data dictionaries and metadata that we mentioned before to decide which columns and rows are important. We will also transfer metadata into R dataframe and combine that with all source files. New statistics will be computed if necessary. With all of these source data and metadata, our analysis and envisionment mentioned in the preceding section are feasible.

Therefore, it is extremely crucial to examine the validity and reliability of the assumptions that our analysis will rely on and think about any inductive biases that we implicitly impose in the analysis. Specifically, there are two important aspects that we want to research on: Assumption 1: the dataset is valid and reliable (i.e. no internal conflicts) Assumption 2: waiting time statistic is a representative metric for analysis 4.1.1 Assumption 1 Unlike most other groups whose datasets come from official sources including government websites and database where verifications are conducted, the dataset we used is collected from a thrid party organization Touringplans.com. Therefore, validation of dataset is necessary and important. We performed our validation by identifying internal conflicts of datasets and compare our preliminary analysis with reports from the official (i.e. Disneyland). The first simple task we tried to validiate our dataset is to predict top seven attractions according to their popularity. In our dataset, we computed the average waiting time for each attraction (denoted by AWT in the plot) and made usage of the average_wait_every_hundred statistic (i.e. denoted by AWT_100 in the plot) to do the prediction. Note that AWT_100 represents the average waiting time for every hundred people. Therefore, attractions that are popular should be those with high AWT but low AWT_100. According to this reasoning, we identified that the top 7 most popular attractions from the scatter plot above: Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Space Mountain, Jungle Cruise, Splash Mountain , Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Pirates of Caribbean, and Haunted Mansions. Based on the report of most popular attractions by magicguides.com and the introduction from Disneyland Officials the most popular 7 attractions are: Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Jungle Cruise , Splash Mountain, Peter Pan’s Flight, Haunted Mansions, Pirates of Caribbean, and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. Our prediction results matched with most of their analysis (6/7), and we can improve our confidence about the reliability of the source data from this small prediction task. In addition, there is no internal conflict in our dataset because they are all time series data for different attractions. 4.1.2 Assumption 2 By calculating and plotting the waiting time for each attraction, we identified that average waiting time itself is not a good indicator for popularity of the attraction. Note that we observe that the average waiting time is not always higher for popular attractions identified in previous section. Thus, we should not solely leverage on that when analyzing the popularity of attractions. However, with the power of time series data, it is powerful when analyzing trend and designing visiting plans. 4.2 General Pattern Analysis - Macro-Level With confidence of dataset validity, we first analyze the pattern of waiting time of each attraction spanning from 2015-01-01 to 2022-01-01, by which we can identify the peak season of Walt Disneyland. Note that for this section, we are doing macro-scale analysis, implying we will focus on the average waiting time for each month for each attraction. 4.2.1 Secular Trends To identify secular trend, we computed the average waiting time for each month for all attractions and then made the following time series plot. Here is the main observations: From 2015 to 2019, there is a general trend of increasing waiting time. Explanation: as Disneyland became more famous, there are more tourists but the attractions remain unchanged, which result in an increasing of waiting time. From about 2019 to 2020, there is a huge decreasing in terms of waiting time. Explanation: this corresponds to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, which result in the temporary close of Disneyland and the huge decreasing of number of tourists even after reopening. Starting from 2020, there is a general trend of increasing waiting time Explanation: this corresponds to the fact that people are back to normal life from COVID disruption. There is an obvious abnormality in the plot (2020-04-01 to 2020-10-01), where the waiting times are all zeros, which correpond to the closure of Disneyland. (Note that there is a design choice for plotting; see Data Cleaning section for details) Note: According to Disneyland’s Officials, Disneyland was closed during COVID-19 outbreaks Below are the time series plot for the average waiting time changing pattern for each attraction in Disneyland. Click on the plots to zoom in. Through this juxtaposition, we can easily observed that the four trends and abnormalites that we identified eariler is universal across all attractions, and we do not subject to Simpson’s Paradox. 4.2.2 Identify cyclical patterns ## X name duration ## 1 0 7 dwarfs train 3.0 ## 2 1 pirates of caribbean 7.5 ## 3 2 astro orbiter 1.5 ## 4 3 regal carrousel 2.0 ## 5 4 big thunder mtn 7.0 ## 6 5 splash mountain 18.0 ## 7 6 space mountain 10.0 ## 8 7 jungle cruise 8.0 ## 9 8 mad tea party 1.5 ## 10 9 dumbo 1.5 ## 11 10 magic carpets 1.5 ## 12 11 peoplemover 10.0 ## 13 12 under the sea 7.0 ## 14 13 barnstormer 2.0 ## 15 14 winnie the pooh 4.0 ## 16 15 enchanted tiki rm 14.5 ## 17 16 haunted mansion 10.0 ## 18 17 buzz lightyear 4.5 4.3 General Pattern Analysis - Micro-Level "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
