[["index.html", "Wait Time at Walt Disney World Chapter 1 Introduction", " Wait Time at Walt Disney World Mildred Ouyang, Xiaoyang Song, Liwen Zhu* (Group 12) 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction Disneyland is one of the most popular themed parks in the world. However, visitors often long wait in lines for each attraction. They may spend hours waiting and enjoy the attraction for less than five minutes. There is no need to mention possible bad weather; waiting in line when it rains or the temperature is below 32 or above 100 Fahrenheit is uncomfortable. The visitors could only enjoy a few attractions in a day while wasting most of their precious time waiting. We all have experienced long waiting for attractions in Disneyland, so we would like to find a way to minimize the waiting time as much as possible. What’s more, Covid-19 has dramatically impacted the world, including Disneyland. Many people choose to stay at home instead of having fun outside. Also, Disneyland was closed on March 16, 2020. We will show how Covid influenced the waiting time. In this project, We will explore Disney Magic Kingdom Park’s historical wait time and discover some patterns. Our findings suggest the waiting time does vary before and after covid began. It is not distributed uniformly yearly, monthly, and daily. There are some times tourists spend less time waiting. Furthermore, we conclude some strategies which help us spend time wisely and enjoy as many attractions as possible. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Many visitors complained about the waiting time at Disneyland. It is possible to wait in line for 6 hours to take a ride (Source). In this project, we are interested in exploring the waiting time at the Disney Magic Kingdom to gain some insights into the general trends and patterns. Moreover, we hope the patterns discovered can help visitors plan their trip wisely to avoid waiting in long lines and enjoy as many attractions as possible in a limited time. In the future, our project can facilitate finding specific hypotheses for further supervised machine-learning studies predicting the waiting time of each attraction. Disney provides an app showing the waiting time for each attraction, but it does not reflect historical data to show the trend. We focus on exploring the waiting times from a larger picture perspective and show how the time varies daily, monthly, and annually. We will also create some graphs to visualize the data and illustrate trends and patterns. 2.2 Data availability The data comes from Touringplans.com. The data includes the most recent daily or hourly average waiting time for some selected attractions in the Magic Kingdom of Disney and the metadata that are useful for conducting analysis. The data can be downloaded directly from the website for free in CSV format. A CSV document downloaded contains all wait time data for a specific attraction. The wait time is recorded at different time intervals (every 1 ~ 10 minutes) for each day. For example, the raw data for attraction Dumbo and Laugh Floor are displayed below. &nbsp; &nbsp; Fig. 1: Example Data for Dumbo (left) and Laugh Floor (right) By our investigation, the data is available for each park opening day from 01/01/2015 to 12/28/2021. Yet, from 04/01/2020 to 10/01/2020, Disneyland was closed, so we don’t have any data during this period. The website provides data for 41 attractions in the Magic Kingdom. Furthermore, we also identified that there is much useful metadata from Touringplans.com. For instance, we have access to the metadata for each attraction of the Magic Kingdom, which records useful information, including its unique code, duration, and where it locates. Note that information like durations is extremely helpful when analyzing the waiting time of attractions. The example dataset is displayed below. Fig. 2: Example Metadata In addition, we found a data dictionary from the same site, which explains the meaning of each attribute in the dataset in detail and helps us disambiguate each column. For example, the attribute SACTMIN stands for the “Actual Wait Time” while SPOSTMIN represents the “Standby Post Wait Time.” As for our plan of importing data, we will manually download all source CSV files (including metadata) and process them into R dataframes. During processing, we will heavily rely on the data dictionaries and metadata that we mentioned before to decide which columns and rows are important. We will also transfer metadata into R dataframe and combine that with all source files. New statistics will be computed if necessary. With all of these source data and metadata, our analysis and envisionment mentioned in the preceding section are feasible. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources The data comes from Touringplans.com, and the website collected all its data from the following three sources: From app users of Touringplans.com The app records the time its users enter waiting lines and enjoy the facility. The difference between these two times is the actual waiting time. Disney’s My Disney Experience app Disneyland estimates the waiting time based on the length of waiting lines. The estimated waiting time is posted on a sign at the entrance to attractions and shown on Disney’s app. Observation from the staffs of Touringplans.com on sights.   The staffs visit Disneyland and record their actual waiting time for each attraction. 3.1.1 Basic Information about Data The data can be downloaded directly from the website for free in CSV format. In total, there are 5143775 time series records plus 95 rows of metadata cocntaining meta information about attraction. A CSV document downloaded contains all wait time data for a specific attraction. The wait time is recorded at different time intervals (every 1 ~ 10 minutes) for each day. Each CSV files consists of four columns, which are “date”, “datetime”, “SACTMIN”, and “SPOSTMIN”. Each columns has the type character, character, integer, and integer accordingly. 3.1.2 Issues &amp; Design Choice: After plotting the raw data (Section 3.3.2), we discovered the following problems: There are no data from April 2020 to October 2020, except August 2020. This is due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and the Magic Kingdom Park was closed. However, there is data for August, so we deemed that these data are recorded due to some error, and we dropped these data from our analysis. We also discovered that the “entities” data table assigned some attractions with the wrong themed land. To correctly group each attraction to the right land, we went to Disney’s official website to find a map and other related information. There are 41 attractions CSV files available to download, but not all these files contain valid data. Some files contain only NA data for wait time, so after filtering out these files, there are only 25 files with valid wait time data. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation After coarse filtering, our datasets have 25 CSV files. Below is an example of how our raw data look like for the attraction Dumbo: ## date datetime SACTMIN SPOSTMIN ## 1 01/01/2015 2015-01-01 07:16:12 NA 10 ## 2 01/01/2015 2015-01-01 07:23:12 NA 10 ## 3 01/01/2015 2015-01-01 07:29:12 NA 10 ## 4 01/01/2015 2015-01-01 07:37:12 NA 15 ## 5 01/01/2015 2015-01-01 07:44:12 NA 10 ## 6 01/01/2015 2015-01-01 07:51:12 NA 10 Below is a list of all the data cleaning/transformation we have performed on raw data: The “date” column is redundant because its values are all contained in the “datetime” column too, so we dropped the “date” column. “SACTMIN” has a lot of missing values, and we observed that when “SPOSTMIN” has missing data, its corresponding “SACTMIN” has a value and vice versa. Hence, we replaced all the missing values in “SPOSTMIN” with the values from “SACTMIN”. If both the “SACTMIN” and “SPOSTMIN” columns are NA, then it means that the row does not have valid wait time data for our analysis, so we drop the row. After combining the “SACTMIN” and “SPOSTMIN” columns, we renamed the old “SPOSTMIN” column to “Waiting Time” and dropped the “SACTMIN” column. In the new “Waiting Time” column, we also checked that if there are values less than 0. Since wait time cannot be negative, we dropped these negative values. Below is an example of how our cleaned data look like for the attraction Dumbo: ## X Datetime Waiting.Time ## 1 0 2015-01-01 09:02:13 10 ## 2 1 2015-01-01 09:09:16 10 ## 3 2 2015-01-01 09:16:12 10 ## 4 3 2015-01-01 09:22:35 10 ## 5 4 2015-01-01 09:23:12 10 ## 6 5 2015-01-01 09:29:12 10 Moreover, in our analysis of wait time based on the time of the day, we also converted the “datetime” column from character type to datetime using as.POSIXlt(). This will allow us to compare time easily. We assigned time before 12 PM to be the morning category, time between 12 PM and before 6 PM to be the afternoon category, and time after 6 PM to be the evening category. 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 Missing Metadata From the above chart, we can see that there are missing data values for all the three variables. These three variables are some general information about each attraction, and we observe that if one variable has missing data, then the other two variables tend to be missing too, only one exception for attraction “enchanted tiki rm”. We dropped the missing data for our analysis. Since they do not have a strong relationship with analyzing the wait time trend. 3.3.2 Missing Time Series Data Since it is not easy to visualize the missing data pattern for time series data, we chose to make three bar charts that represent the number of data records for each month between January 2015 and December 2021. As a result, we found that there is a gap between April 2020 and October 2020, corresponding to our previous discovery of potentially wrong data. In addition, from the plot above, we can observe that the number of data points are approxmately equivalent for each month before COVID disruption; but after COVID, the number of data points decrease, corresponding to the fact that there are fewer tourists after COVID outbreaks. However, we identified that the data points for each month are sufficient for us to do analysis in later part. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Assumption 4.2 General Pattern Analysis - Macro-Level 4.3 General Pattern Analysis - Micro-Level 4.4 Attraction-Level AWT Analysis", " Chapter 4 Results × 4.1 Assumption As introduced in the data cleaning section, our exploratory analysis is heavily based on the waiting_time statistics of attractions in the Walt Disneyland collected from thrid-party organization. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to examine the validity and reliability of the assumptions that our analysis will rely on and think about any inductive biases that we implicitly impose in the analysis. Specifically, there are two important aspects that we want to research on: Assumption 1: the dataset is valid and reliable (i.e. no internal conflicts) Assumption 2: waiting time statistic is a representative metric for analysis 4.1.1 Assumption 1 Unlike most other groups whose datasets come from official sources including government websites and database where verifications are conducted, the dataset we used is collected from a thrid party organization Touringplans.com. Therefore, validation of dataset is necessary and important. We performed our validation by identifying internal conflicts of datasets and compare our preliminary analysis with reports from the official (i.e. Disneyland). The first simple task we tried to validiate our dataset is to predict top seven attractions according to their popularity. In our dataset, we computed the average waiting time for each attraction (denoted by AWT in the plot) and made usage of the average_wait_every_hundred statistic (i.e. denoted by AWT_100 in the plot) to do the prediction. Note that AWT_100 represents the average waiting time for every hundred people. Therefore, attractions that are popular should be those with high AWT but low AWT_100. According to this reasoning, we identified that the top 7 most popular attractions from the scatter plot above: Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Space Mountain, Jungle Cruise, Splash Mountain , Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Pirates of Caribbean, and Haunted Mansions. Based on the report of most popular attractions by magicguides.com and the introduction from Disneyland Officials the most popular 7 attractions are: Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Jungle Cruise , Splash Mountain, Peter Pan’s Flight, Haunted Mansions, Pirates of Caribbean, and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. Our prediction results matched with most of their analysis (6/7), and we can improve our confidence about the reliability of the source data from this small prediction task. In addition, there is no internal conflict in our dataset because they are all time series data for different attractions. 4.1.2 Assumption 2 By calculating and plotting the waiting time for each attraction, we identified that average waiting time itself is not a good indicator for popularity of the attraction. Note that we observe that the average waiting time is not always higher for popular attractions identified in previous section. Thus, we should not solely leverage on that when analyzing the popularity of attractions. However, with the power of time series data, it is powerful when analyzing trend and designing visiting plans. 4.2 General Pattern Analysis - Macro-Level With confidence of dataset validity, we first analyze the pattern of waiting time of each attraction spanning from 2015-01-01 to 2022-01-01, by which we can identify the peak season of Walt Disneyland. Note that for this section, we are doing macro-scale analysis, implying we will focus on the average waiting time for each month for each attraction. 4.2.1 Secular Trends To identify secular trend, we computed the average waiting time for each month for all attractions and then made the following time series plot. Here is the main observations: Obs #1: From 2015 to 2019, there is a general trend of increasing waiting time. Exp: as Disneyland became more famous, there are more tourists but the attractions remain unchanged, which result in an increasing of waiting time. Obs #2: From about 2019 to 2020, there is a huge decreasing in terms of waiting time. Exp: this corresponds to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, which result in the temporary close of Disneyland and the huge decreasing of number of tourists even after reopening. Obs #3: Starting from 2020, there is a general trend of increasing waiting time Exp: this corresponds to the fact that people are back to normal life from COVID disruption. Obs #4: There is an obvious abnormality in the plot (2020-04-01 to 2020-10-01), where the waiting times are all zeros, which correpond to the closure of Disneyland. (Note that there is a design choice for plotting; see Data Cleaning section for details) Note: According to Disneyland’s Officials, Disneyland was closed during COVID-19 outbreaks Below are the time series plot for the average waiting time changing pattern for each attraction in Disneyland. Click on the plots to zoom in. Through this juxtaposition, we can easily observed that the four trends and abnormalites that we identified eariler is universal across all attractions, and we do not subject to Simpson’s Paradox. 4.2.2 Identify cyclical patterns Time series data commonly share some underlying cyclical patterns. We utilized faceting techniques to isolate average waiting time for each year and identify the following trends and patterns: (Explanations are based on news, activities, and reports published by Disneyland Officials) Obs #1: We managed to identify cyclical patterns by isolating AWT for each year. Obs #2: In general, there are two peaks of AWT for attractions in Disneyland: April - Late May (spring peak) and December - January (winter peak). Exp: Spring AWT peak corresponds to the fact that there are tons of activities held in that period, whereas winter peak is the direct result of Christmas Holiday (Note that Florida is a good place to stay for many people during winter). Obs #3: In 2020, we observed a completely different trend due to the temporary closure of the park. Obs #4: In 2021, the general AWT decreases but the peaks are still around spring and winter. Exp: the decreasing waiting time (compared to 2015 to 2019) accounts for the influence of COVID-19 to people’s life, while the consistency of peak seasons confirmed the validity of previously-observed trends. Similarly, we can plot the AWT for each attraction as what we did for the previous section to further confirm the global trends. Click on the plots below to zoom in. Here are the main takeaway from these plots: Obs #1: Most of the attractions share the similar patterns as identified before. Obs #2: For attractions whose data are not sufficiently large (refer to Data Cleaning section for details), spring and winter peaks are observed as well. Obs #3: Combined previous two observations, we can safely conclude that we do not suffer from Simpson’s Paradox and the trend is valid. Obs #4: From this juxtapositin, we can easily discover features about each attraction. For example, we can quickly guess that Hall of Presidents was closed in 2017 (annoucement from Disneyland Officials confirmed our conjecture). 4.2.3 Section Conclusion A main takeaway of this macro-level analysis for tourists is that spring and winter are two peak seasons that the AWT is higher than that of other time; this trend is exhibited both before and after COVID-19, and will be consistent in the future. Therefore, one natural suggestion is to visit the park in summer or fall. 4.3 General Pattern Analysis - Micro-Level Based on our exploratory analysis in the previous section, AWT of all attractions is a good representation of AWT of each attraction. This crucial observation allowed us to conduct micro-level analysis on the cyclical pattern that we identified earlier. 4.3.1 AWT vs. Days Specifically, we focused on the AWT of all attractions for each day in a year. Although we have already identified that there are two peaks (spring and winter) of AWT, we hope that this micro-level analysis can bring more intuitions about the underlying reasons. From the graph above, we have the following observations: Obs #1: We clearly identified that there are two periods where the AWT decrease significantly: Late August to Early September and Beginning of January Exp: One possible explanation is that by the start of the Winter semester, students, who occupy a large proportion of visitors, are going back to school, resulting in fewer visitors to Disneyland. Obs #2: In this micro-level analysis, we manage to identify the thrid peak, which is around Late June to Early August. Exp: This corresponds to the fact that most schools (ranging from Universities to Kindergarten) are in vacations. Obs #3: confirmed the effectiveness and necessity of this micro-level analysis. Recall in previous section, we discovered that there is an abnormal pattern in 2020 due to COVID disruption. Therefore, a plot like above may not be sufficient to capture this variation. Therefore, we manually filtered the data and compare the patterns of AWT before and after COVID outbreak. Specifically, we manually classify the periods before 2020-01-01 as Before COVID period and time after 2021-01-01 as the After COVID periods. The reasoning behind this is that the COVID outbreaks occurred at the beginning of 2020 and it is under control at the end of 2020 according to the report from CDC. The second reason is inherited from the internal nature of our dataset, where we have tons of missing data between 2020-04-01 and 2020-10-01 due to Disneyland’s closure; thus, it is reasonable to remove the data from whole year and use this year as a threshold. Based on our plots, here are the main observations: Obs #1: There is a trend of decreasing AWT for nearly all time periods in a year after COVID outbreak. Exp: the concerns of public safety prevented many people from going out and travelling. Obs #2: There exists outlier of the trend in Obs #1: in Christmas, the AWT is higher than before. Exp: Recall our threshold for After COVID period is 2021-01-01 to 2022-01-01, so in December 2022, there is already 1.5 years since COVID’s outbreak so people’s life is getting back to normal. Obs #3: After COVID-19 shutdown, in January, there is a significant drop in AWT compared to patterns before COVID-19. Exp: Again, public safety concerns and schools reopening led to less tourists. 4.3.2 AWT vs. Weekday In the previous section, we move from a macro-level analysis to a micro-level analysis by focusing on each day in a year. Similarly, we can do one step further to examine the AWT for each day in a week in order to identify the patterns within a week. According to the plot above, here are the main observations: Obs #1: We do expect Saturday has a relatively high waiting time before we start the project. Obs #2: On the other hand, surprisingly, Sunday has the least AWT, while AWT of Monday and Wednesday are above average. Obs #3: However, even though there are difference among each day in a week, the difference is not huge. The maximum difference is only about 5 minutes. Similarly, we can make plots to examine the patterns before and after COVID-19, and we sticked with the thresholds that we used in previous sections. The graph above showed that the AWT for each weekday before COVID-19 is lower than that after COVID-19. Obs #1: By calculation, AWT dropped from 31.45 minutes to 26.26 minutes. This indicates that on average, for every 2.5 hours, the tourists can enjoy one more attraction after the Covid than before. Obs #2: Similarly, the difference is still not huge among all weekdays, implying that weekday is not a huge factor that impacts people’s traveling plan to Disneyland. 4.4 Attraction-Level AWT Analysis 4.4.1 AWT vs. Attraction The above is a Ridgeline plot that shows the wait time distribution of the top five attractions with the longest wait time, and they are ranked by their medians in descending order with the longest time at the top. Obs #1: The ranking is almost the same as in the average wait time chart, except Space Mountain and Peter Pan’s Flight switched order Obs #2: All of data have unimodel distribution except Splash Mountain Obs #3: The modes are around 50 minutes Obs #4: There are some waiting time less than 0 minute Exp: There should be a clear cut at 0 minute. However, to make the graph smooth, we have some data showed less than zero. 4.4.2 AWT vs. Attraction: time of a day The above Cleveland dot plot shows the average wait time of each attractive at different time of the day. The plot is sorted by the average afternoon wait time in descending order from top to bottom. Obs #1: For 23 out of the 25 attractions, the average afternoon wait time is the longest. For the other 2 rides, the average morning wait time is the highest. Obs #2: For 17 out of 25 attractions, the average evening wait time is the shortest, and for the other 8 attractions, the average morning wait time is the shortest. Obs #3: The attractions of the top 5 average afternoon wait time hold the same order as in the top 5 average wait time. 4.4.3 AWT of Attractions vs. Land The above bar chart shows the average wait time by each themed land, and it is sorted by descending order from the top. Obs #1: Frontierland has the longest average wait time followed by Tomorrowland. The rest have similar average wait time. Obs #2: The top 3 longest average wait time attractions - Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Space Mountain, and Peter Pan’s Flight - are not in the Frontierland. Exp: This illustrates Simpson’s Paradox. The above Cleveland dot plot shows the average wait time by each land at different time of the day. The plot is sorted by the average afternoon wait time in descending order from top to bottom. Obs #1: The order of themed lands is the same as the one in the average wait time plot. Obs #2: For all themed lands, the average afternoon wait time is the longest. Obs #3: The average evening time is the shortest for 4 of the 5 themed lands. Only one themed land has morning as the the shortest average wait time. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 AWT vs. Duration 5.2 AWT_100 vs. Duration 5.3 Future Work", " Chapter 5 Interactive component For interactive components, we chose to focus on two variables in our datasets: AWT and Duration. Note that in the Assumption section, we managed to identify 7 popular attractions by observing the distributions of AWT and AWT_100, where we conclude that attractions with high AWT bu low AWT_100 are popular. However, Duration and AWT can also be a good indicator when predicting whether an attraction is popular or not. Also, in previous section, we found it is hard to tell which point corresponds to which attraction; therefore, in this section, we will exploit the advantages of D3 and interactive plots to make our plots more straightforward and readable. 5.1 AWT vs. Duration The plot below is an interactive scatterplot of the duration of a attraction and the AWT, drawn using D3. Note: Moving the mouse to the data point to see more information and click on the button to see popular attractions. Identify Popular Attractions Original Plot Generally, there are several trends: Obs #1: If we remove two datapoints (the top-left one and the bottom-right one), there is a general trend of positive correlation between AWT and Duration of that attraction, which is a natural phenomenon to observe. Obs #2: Similarly as in the Assumption section, we want to identify popularity by looking at the pattern from this plot; however, unlike before, there is no obvious pattern that can help us predct the popularity of attrcations. Exp: In general, the Duration of the attraction is something that is fixed and static once the park opened, which had nothing to do with the preferences of tourists; on the other hand, AWT_100 is closely related to customers’ preferences and populariy. Obs #3: Even though it is not as obvious as before, we can weakly conclude that popular attractions usually had higher AWT andd Duration. But again, we can only make conjecture about this. The pattern is not super obvious and maybe spurious. 5.2 AWT_100 vs. Duration The discovery in previous section led us to discover the relationship between AWT_100 and Duration. Intuitively, there should exists a positive correlation between AWT_100 and Duration because a longer attraction should normally have longer waiting time; therefore, for every 100 people, the waiting time is supposed to be longer as well. We chose to investigated this issue using D3 techniques again. Below is the D3 plot. Note: Moving the mouse to the data point to see more information and click on the button to see popular attractions. Identify Popular Attractions Original Plot Surprisingly, we found the results and patterns that are counter-intuitive at the frst glance. Here are the main observations and explanations: Obs #1: Instead of positive correlation, there seems existing a negative correlation between AWT_100 and Duration. Exp: At the first glance, this seems not correct. However, this might because that attractions that have longer Duration sometimes also have larger capcity to balance its waiting time. Imagine the case where attractions with longer Duration share similar capcity as others: it will absolutely result in the imbalance of waiting time in the Disneyland and will make the burden of some attractions much heavier than that of others. This is something that the Disneyland Official wants to prevent for sure. Therefore, this negative correlation makes sense. Note: Unfortunately, we do not have accurate data about the capacity of each attraction (different sources document them differently and Disneyland Officials do not provide those information). But based on our research, our conjecture is intuitive. 5.3 Future Work Originally, we want to do an interactive map for this section, where users can click on each part of Disneyland on the map to see the detailed information of attractions. However, we spent tons of time (at least 5 hours) on finding empty maps that we can work on; all of the maps that we can find are those with colors, annotations, and labels. In the future, if we can find a valid map that we can work wtih, we will extend this interactive section to enable more advance interactivity, and hopefully those results can be more meaniingful. In addition, since we are majorly dealing with time series data, interactive components are not easy to do. In the future, we will try to visualize the time series data using D3 to improve this project. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Recommendation &amp; Lessons Learned 6.2 Future Directions", " Chapter 6 Conclusion The waiting time in Disneyland has a seasonal pattern. Tourists need to wait longer time during Spring and Winter than in Summer and Fall. We believe it is related to students’ schedules. The average waiting time (AWT) significantly drops after the spring semester and the fall semester begins. There are also two small sudden peaks around the Fall break and the Thanksgiving break. Besides the seasonal pattern, we also notice that people need to wait more on Saturday and Monday. In comparison, Sunday and Thursday cost less time waiting. What’s more, due to Covid-19, the AWT in recent two years is less than before 2020. 6.1 Recommendation &amp; Lessons Learned We recommend tourists visit Disneyland on a Sunday during Fall. The weather is comfortable, and they don’t have to wait for a long time. Based on the average wait time analysis, we can conclude that if a visitor wants to take the most popular attraction, the Seven Dwarf Mine Train, then the best time to visit is after 6 PM because the average wait time is the shortest in the evening. For the second most popular attraction, Space Mountain, the best time to visit is in the morning. The best time to visit the third most popular attraction, Splash Mountain, is either in the morning before 12 PM or in the evening after 6 PM. The best time to visit the forth most popular attraction, Jungle Cruise, is in the evening. Lastly, it is better to visit the fifth most popular attraction, Big Thunder Mountain, in either the morning or evening. Other than the popular attractions, Peter Pan’s flight has the third highest AWT, and the best time to go is in the evening. 6.2 Future Directions From our exploratory analysis, we observed that there are some common trends and cyclical patterns in the historical wait time. Our project serves as a solid and directed base for possible supervised machine learning studies. Models can be designed to predict the wait time at Magic Kingdom. Other than only using the wait time data, other categories of data can also be incorporated to discover more patterns. For example, weather data, flight ticket price data, and hotel price data can be used to find correlations with wait time. What’s more, there is limited data after Covid. Our conclusions on the difference before and after Covid will be more solid if we repeat the project years later.
