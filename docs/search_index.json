However, visitors often spend a long time waiting for facilities. They may wait for hours for a five-minute roller coaster. Thus, we want to find a way to spend less time waiting and enjoy as many facilities as possible. In this project, we will examine the data of Disneyland waiting times, find the pattern, and provide an optimal visit plan.

We will try to find the pattern for every year, such as a possible peak appearing every summer. We will also create a heat map showing the number of people waiting in lines in Disneyland and how it changes throughout the day. Besides, the correlation between different factors will also be reported. 2.2 Data availability The data comes from THRILL-DATA. The data includes the most recent daily or hourly average waiting time for every facility in the area for decades.
