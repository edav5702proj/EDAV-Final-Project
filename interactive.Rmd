## _AWT_ vs. Duration

The plot below shows the scatterplot of the duration of a attraction and the average waiting time (AWT). 
Generally, duration and waiting time are positively correlated. The longer the duration, the longer the waiting time.
There are also some outliers, such as the 7 dwarf train. This attraction only lasts 3 minutes, but the tourists must wait 79 minutes on average. Another example is Enchanted Tiki Room, which has a duration of 15 minutes and AWT of 5 minutes. What's more, all the popular attractions require a long waiting time, at least 30 minutes.</p>
